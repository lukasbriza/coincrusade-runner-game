# 🎮 COIN CRUSADE: KNIGHT'S QUEST

**An Endless 2D Runner Game**  
Conquer obstacles, collect coins, and adapt to AI-driven challenges in this unique endless-runner experience.  
Choose from four intelligent difficulty generators that shape the gameplay dynamically.
In **COIN CRUSADE: KNIGHT'S QUEST**, players take on the role of a brave knight navigating an endless world filled with AI-generated obstacles and challenges. Your objective is to run, jump, and collect coins while the game intelligently adjusts its difficulty based on your gameplay.

## 🧠 Dynamic Difficulty Generators

The game features **four unique AI-based difficulty generators**, each offering a different experience:

### 🔹 **Linear Generator**

- The difficulty increases progressively over time, independent of the player's performance.

### 🔹 **Hamlet System**

- Difficulty adapts dynamically based on the player's performance in each section of the game.
- Inspired by **Stock Theory**.

### 🔹 **Neural Network Generator**

- Adjusts gameplay difficulty using data collected during your runs, analyzed through a **neural network**.

### 🔹 **Reinforcement Learning Generator**

- Uses **reinforcement learning** to optimize challenges as you play.
- The longer you play, the smarter the game becomes at estimating your skill level.
